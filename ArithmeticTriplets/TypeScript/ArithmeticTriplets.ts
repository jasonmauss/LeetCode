// Solution for: https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-arithmetic-triplets/
const arithmeticTriplets = (nums: number[], diff: number): number => {

    return 0;

};





// some test cases
console.log(arithmeticTriplets([0,1,4,6,7,10], 3)); // 2
console.log(arithmeticTriplets([4,5,6,7,8,9], 2)); // 2
