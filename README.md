### TypeScript

Some TypeScript solutions will require the supporting type definitions for Node to be installed if you want to run the .js file emitted by the TypeScript compiler through Node to test it. You can run `npm install @types/node --save-dev` from your terminal to get them.

### JavaScript
The JavaScript solutions can be run in your favorite browser Console or through Node in the terminal.
